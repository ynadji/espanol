1
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,760
<i>Stop or I’ll shoot!</i>

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,720
<i>No!</i>

3
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,400
<i>My name’s Tokyo.</i>

4
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,560
<i>But when this story started,
<i>that wasn’t my name.</i></i>

5
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,760
SUSPECT'S WHEREABOUTS UNKNOWN

6
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,680
<i>This was me.</i>

7
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,520
<i>And this, the love of my life.</i>

8
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,560
ROBBER GETS SHOT DEAD

9
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,080
<i>The last time I saw him he was
<i>in a pool of blood with his eyes open.</i></i>

10
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,160
<i>We did 15 clean heists.</i>

11
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,400
<i>But mixing love and work never works.</i>

12
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,440
<i>So, when the security guard shot,
<i>I had to change my job.</i></i>

13
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,000
<i>From thief to murderer.</i>

14
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,520
<i>And that’s how I started to run away.</i>

15
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,920
<i>Somehow, I was dead too.</i>

16
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,960
<i>Or almost dead.</i>

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,600
<i>I had been hidden for 11 days</i>

19
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,080
<i>and my photo wallpapered
<i>police stations all over Spain.</i></i>

20
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,640
<i>I’d get a 30 years’ sentence.</i>

21
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,720
<i>And I’m really not the type of girl
<i>who likes getting old in prison.</i></i>

22
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,360
<i>I prefer running away.</i>

23
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,480
<i>Body and soul.</i>

24
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,000
<i>And if I can’t take my body there,</i>

25
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,040
<i>at least let my soul escape.</i>

26
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,680
<i>I had no time left and there were
<i>important things I had to do.</i></i>

27
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,400
<i>Just one, really.</i>

28
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,160
Hello?

29
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,200
<i>Mum?</i>

30
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,680
Oh, my girl.

31
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,600
<i>How are you, sweetheart?</i>

32
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,640
What’s happening?

33
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,360
<i>Haven’t you seen the news?</i>

34
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,760
All those things they say about me.

35
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,200
Yes, of course I’ve seen them.

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,840
You know what?

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,640
I’m thinking about going on a journey.

38
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,480
<i>I may join a Chinese ship.</i>

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,840
<i>As a cook.</i>

40
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,280
<i>Didn’t you say
<i>I couldn’t even make an omelette?</i></i>

41
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,800
<i>So I’ll learn. What do you think?</i>

42
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,000
I don’t know, sweetheart.

43
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,080
What if they only eat Chinese food?

44
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,720
What does that journey mean,

45
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,080
<i>that I won’t see you again?</i>

46
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,120
Don’t talk nonsense.

47
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,760
Of course you’ll see me.

48
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,960
<i>I’ll buy you a ticket
<i>so you can come to visit me.</i></i>

49
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,480
Visit you where?

50
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,960
At the cemetery?

51
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,520
Are you alone?

52
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,000
<i>Mum, are you alone?</i>

53
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,400
Yes.

54
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,440
<i>Then go out to the street,
<i>as if you went to the market.</i></i>

55
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,880
<i>I’ll find you.</i>

56
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,880
<i>And that day,
<i>the day I was going to the slaughterhouse,</i></i>

57
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,080
<i>my guardian angel appeared.</i>

58
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,200
<i>But you never know for certain
<i>what a guardian angel looks like,</i></i>

59
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,600
<i>and you’d never imagine
<i>he’d appear in a Seat Ibiza</i></i>

60
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,120
<i>of 1992.</i>

61
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,960
Excuse me, have you got a minute?

62
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,800
No.

63
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,240
Cooking in a Chinese ship
only has one advantage...

64
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,200
you don’t have to do the washing-up.

65
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,280
<i>For a moment I thought about the Chinese</i>

66
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,720
<i>and that I hate people who spit.</i>

67
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,080
-Who are you, a policeman?
-Wait.

68
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,600
You’re going to the slaughterhouse,
there’s a squad waiting for you

69
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,280
and the UIT has been sitting in a car
for the past six days...

70
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,800
Why would I believe you?

71
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,520
<i>And that’s how I met the Professor,</i>

72
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,200
<i>pointing a gun to his balls.</i>

73
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,120
May I?

74
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,920
<i>The good thing about relationships</i>

75
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,240
<i>is that you finally forget
<i>how they started.</i></i>

76
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,480
May I?

77
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,240
They’re already in your mother’s house.

78
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,960
That’s why I came to help you.

79
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,600
I want to propose you some business,

80
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,160
a heist, a heist that’s...

81
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,120
singular.

82
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,360
I’m looking for people who...

83
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,400
Well, people who don’t have much to lose.

84
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,680
What do you think about...

85
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,440
2,400 million euros?

86
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,240
<i>Nobody had done a job like that,</i>

87
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,360
<i>neither in New York,
<i>nor in London, nor in Monte Carlo.</i></i>

88
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,600
<i>So if my picture had to be
<i>again in the papers,</i></i>

89
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,320
<i>at least it’d be due
<i>to the biggest heist ever.</i></i>

90
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,040
WELCOME

91
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,080
I welcome you,

92
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,880
and...

93
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,080
I thank you for having accepted this...

94
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,440
this job offer.

95
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,920
We’ll live here,
far from the worldly noise.

96
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,160
Five months, the five months
we’ll spend studying

97
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,840
-how to do the job.
-What do you mean, five months?

98
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,480
Are we crazy?

99
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:45,080
Look, people spend years studying

100
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,960
to earn a salary,
a salary which, in the best of cases,

101
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,840
is just a salary, a shitty salary.

102
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,480
What are five months?

103
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,040
I’ve been thinking about this...

104
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,480
for much longer.

105
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,240
Not to have to work ever again.

106
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,760
Neither you

107
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,080
nor your children.

108
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,840
Okay.

109
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,880
You don’t know each other yet
and I want it go on like that.

110
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,880
I don’t want any names,

111
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,920
or personal questions,

112
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,080
or, of course, personal relationships.

113
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,840
I want each of you to choose a name,
something simple.

114
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,720
It can be numbers, planets, cities...

115
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:46,200
-Like "Mister 17, Miss 23."
-That’s a wrong start.

116
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,280
-I can't remember my telephone number.
-That’s why I said that.

117
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,640
-And planets?
-I can be Mars, and he Uranus.

118
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,760
I won’t be Uranus, so forget it.

119
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,560
-What’s wrong with Uranus?
-I don’t like how it rhymes.

120
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,800
-It’ll be cities. Cities.
-So cities it is.

121
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,400
Okay.

122
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,720
<i>That’s how I ended up being Tokyo.</i>

123
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,040
<i>The one looking at my arse is Mr Berlin.</i>

124
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,480
<i>Under arrest warrant.</i>

125
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,000
<i>27 heists.</i>

126
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,480
<i>Jewelleries, auction houses
<i>and security vans.</i></i>

127
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,960
<i>His biggest job,
<i>the Champs-Élysées, in Paris.</i></i>

128
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,120
<i>434 diamonds.</i>

129
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,960
<i>He’s like a shark in a swimming pool.</i>

130
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,600
<i>You can swim with him,
<i>but you’re never calm.</i></i>

131
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,280
<i>And he was the boss
<i>in charge of the assault.</i></i>

132
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,200
<i>The one who coughs is Mr Moscow.</i>

133
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,400
<i>The first thing he dug was a mine,
<i>in Asturias.</i></i>

134
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,600
MOSCOW

135
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,800
<i>Then he understood
<i>that digging upwards he’d go further.</i></i>

136
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,120
<i>Six fur shops, three clock shops
<i>and the land bank in Avilés.</i></i>

137
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,720
<i>He uses the thermal lance
<i>and any industrial equipment.</i></i>

138
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,960
<i>The one sitting
<i>behind Moscow is Denver, his son.</i></i>

139
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,760
<i>Drugs, teeth, broken ribs.</i>

140
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,280
<i>He’s the king of fights in discos.</i>

141
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,760
<i>Pure hot blood.</i>

142
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,440
<i>In a perfect plan, a time bomb.</i>

143
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,440
<i>Rio. He’s my weakness.</i>

144
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,520
<i>He’s like Mozart, but with computers.</i>

145
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,520
<i>He programs since he was six and knows
<i>everything about alarms and electronics.</i></i>

146
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,240
<i>For the rest of things in life
<i>it’s as if he had been born yesterday.</i></i>

147
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,960
<i>And those are the Siamese twins,
<i>Helsinki and Oslo.</i></i>

148
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,640
<i>Even the most sophisticated plan
<i>needs soldiers,</i></i>

149
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,240
<i>and who better than two Serbs.</i>

150
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,560
<i>Maybe they think,
<i>but, frankly, we’ll never know.</i></i>

151
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:28,960
<i>Nairobi,</i>

152
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,080
<i>a hardened optimist.</i>

153
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,800
<i>She has forged banknotes since she was 13.</i>

154
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,800
<i>And now she’s our quality manager.</i>

155
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,080
<i>She might be crazy,
<i>but she’s really funny.</i></i>

156
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:45,640
Think that every day
they’ll talk about us in the news,

157
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:49,000
every family in the country
will be wondering

158
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,880
what we’re doing.

159
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,920
And you know what they’ll think?

160
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,600
They’ll think: "Bastards!
I wish I had come up with that idea."

161
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,840
<i>The Professor,
<i>no criminal record, no register.</i></i>

162
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,120
<i>The last time he renewed his ID he was 19.</i>

163
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:10,680
<i>To all intents, a ghost,
<i>but a very smart ghost.</i></i>

164
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,520
We’re not stealing... anybody’s money,

165
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,200
they’ll even think we’re nice.

166
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,520
And that is vital.

167
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,640
It’s vital we have the public opinion
on our side.

168
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,520
We’re going to be the fucking heroes
of all those people.

169
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,000
But very careful,

170
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,800
because the moment there is
a single drop of blood,

171
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,040
this is very important,

172
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,320
if there’s a single victim,

173
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:45,240
we’ll stop being Robin Hoods
and we’ll simply become sons of bitches.

174
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,440
Professor.

175
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,520
Miss Tokyo.

176
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,600
What are we robbing?

177
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,000
The Royal Mint of Spain.

178
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,920
DAY OF THE HEIST
FRIDAY 8:35 A.M.

179
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,040
Who chose the mask?

180
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,600
-What’s up with the mask?
-It’s not scary.

181
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,560
In heist films the masks are scary.

182
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,240
They’re zombies, skeletons,
the death, I don’t know, you feel...

183
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,000
With a gun in his hand

184
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,120
I assure you a madman
is scarier than a skeleton.

185
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,360
-Stop it.
-Who is this guy with the moustache?

186
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,840
Dalí, son, a Spanish painter.
He was very good.

187
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,920
-A painter.
-Yes.

188
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,480
-A painter of paintings.
-Yes.

189
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,040
Do you know what’s fucking scary?
Dolls for children.

190
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,720
They’re really scary.

191
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,680
What dolls?

192
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,880
Goofy, Pluto, Mickey Mouse, all those.

193
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,560
A mouse with ears is scarier,
that’s what you’re saying?

194
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,600
Yes, arsehole.
Do you want me to slap you?

195
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,720
-Hey!
-I’m right. Listen to me.

196
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
If a guy at gunpoint
and wearing a Mickey Mouse mask

197
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,360
gets in a place,
the people will think he’s nuts,

198
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,360
and he's about to do a massacre.
Do you know why?

199
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,760
Because guns and children

200
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,760
are two things
you never put together, daddy.

201
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,920
-Am I right or not?
-Seen that way it’d be more dangerous,

202
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,920
more twisted.

203
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,080
So a Jesus Christ mask
would frighten more, he’s more innocent.

204
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,800
They say "It doesn’t suit you,
it’s like Christ with two guns."

205
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,320
-"Like a saint with two guns."
-It doesn’t matter.

206
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,920
<i>It was obvious
<i>there was a lack of women in the gang.</i></i>

207
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,520
<i>A woman can spend two days
<i>choosing shoes for a wedding,</i></i>

208
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,560
<i>but she’d never spend a single minute
<i>choosing masks for a heist.</i></i>

209
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,360
<i>Everything we had planned
<i>was starting now.</i></i>

210
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:14,080
<i>And during those fractions of a second
<i>I thought about all the innocent people</i></i>

211
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,520
<i>whose lives we would stop
<i>in their tracks.</i></i>

212
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,880
E-80 LOCAL ROAD

213
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,760
<i>The Professor knew
<i>there was just one way to come</i></i>

214
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,960
<i>in the Royal Mint of Spain
<i>with three tonnes</i></i>

215
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,240
of explosive devices.

216
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,720
<i>It had to be done in the lorry
<i>that entered the building every week</i></i>

217
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,680
<i>with the new paper money rolls
<i>ready to be printed.</i></i>

218
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,520
<i>And that was what we were going to do,</i>

219
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,000
<i>we'll get into the kitchen,
<i>escorted by the National Police.</i></i>

220
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,000
DETOUR THROUGH RASCAFRÍA

221
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,280
<i>In Spain, anything guarded
<i>by two police cars</i></i>

222
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,520
<i>is something heavily protected.</i>

223
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,200
<i>But if you inhibit any possibility</i>

224
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,440
<i>for their communication
<i>through the radio or telephone</i></i>

225
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:10,400
<i>and if you point two 26-year-old kids
<i>with five assault rifles at their heads,</i></i>

226
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,120
<i>it doesn’t matter if they have guns,</i>

227
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,360
<i>they would feel just like any of us.</i>

228
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,200
I said get out of the fucking car!

229
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,400
<i>Scared shitless.</i>

230
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,600
You’ll do as I say!

231
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,760
<i>Courage and heroism have a price,</i>

232
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,800
<i>and it’s greater
<i>than the 1,600 euros a month</i></i>

233
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,200
<i>a kid with a uniform gets...</i>

234
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,800
Open the lorry, do you hear me?

235
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,160
<i>...or a lorry driver.</i>

236
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,360
Come on, damn it, open!

237
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,760
<i>If those men had had their daughter
<i>on the back of the lorry,</i></i>

238
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,240
<i>they’d never have opened it,
<i>but who cares about</i></i>

239
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,200
<i>some paper money rolls with a watermark?</i>

240
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,640
Hurry up!

241
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,040
Fuck, man! Come on!

242
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,360
Come on!

243
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:58,880
Sit down. Now calm down, the three of you,
otherwise, I'll blow with the rifle.

244
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,480
You’ll drive with a gun in your kidneys.

245
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,080
When you get the radio call
to know if everything’s all right,

246
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,200
you’ll answer coolly,
as if everything ran smoothly.

247
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,840
Am I clear?

248
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,360
<i>And in the middle of that chaos with guns</i>

249
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,280
<i>I remembered the night before
<i>I had been asked for my hand in marriage</i></i>

250
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,800
<i>and that I’d have preferred other plans.</i>

251
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:26,680
<i>But if you think about it,
<i>you never find a good day for a heist.</i></i>

252
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,960
Now you know what you have to do.

253
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,160
Don’t take your eyes off the girl.

254
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,120
There can’t be any mistakes, all right?

255
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,760
She’s 17.

256
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,320
I think I can handle her.

257
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,800
Can I sit by your side?

258
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,800
Yes.

259
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,320
Hello.

260
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,840
Hello.

261
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,960
Do you want to go out with me?

262
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,480
Okay. I’m leaving.

263
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,160
No, no.

264
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,320
I don’t have to think about it.

265
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,480
I mean, yes.

266
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,080
<i>Okay, children, we’ve arrived.</i>

267
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,960
Let’s go straight
to the museum’s hall, where...

268
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,040
Pedro, please, don’t behave like in class.

269
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,000
Let’s go out in an orderly way,
using both doors...

270
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,080
And this is the façade
of the Royal Mint of Spain.

271
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,560
The little lamb is coming in.

272
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,040
Perfect.

273
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,800
Berlin, your turn.

274
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:18,600
ROYAL MINT OF SPAIN

275
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,360
And now, be careful what you do.

276
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,200
How are you, Javi? Where’s Rafita?

277
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,840
Shift change.

278
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,560
Very well. Keep calm.

279
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,000
Okay, children, get in.

280
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,320
Slowly.

281
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,760
This is important.
As soon as we get the accreditations...

282
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,840
Keep you accreditations
hanging from your neck.

283
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,480
They must be visible
during the whole visit, okay?

284
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,400
Don’t turn around.

285
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,120
When you’re next to me,
I can’t even breathe.

286
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,000
Well, breathe,

287
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,280
because in nine months
you will really be out of breath.

288
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,360
Go ahead.

289
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,040
Well visible during the whole visit,
children.

290
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,960
The accreditation around your neck.
Lower your voice.

291
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,480
Berlin, the first camera, on your left.

292
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,000
Aren’t you going to say anything?

293
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,960
I tell you I’m pregnant,
and you just keep calm?

294
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,000
What shall I do, call my wife,
tell her to pick up the children

295
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,200
and we all go to celebrate?
For God’s sake!

296
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,680
Go on, go on. Come on.

297
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,800
ACCESS TO SECURITY SYSTEM

298
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,120
Coming in.

299
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,520
Be alert, Tokyo.

300
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,520
ACCESS TO ALARM SYSTEM

301
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,800
Great!

302
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,200
-<i>Alarms disengaged.
-Now.</i>

303
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,560
Go ahead, come on.

304
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,680
It was you who said yesterday
that things were bad,

305
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,520
you can’t stand her, you have problems.

306
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,360
Problems just like any couple, Monica,

307
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,560
like any other married couple
with three children,

308
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,920
not that I want to get divorced.

309
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:25,080
Monica, I’ve had three children,
all of them with in vitro fertilisation.

310
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,240
I’ve been having sterile intercourses
with my wife for over 20 years

311
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,440
and now you tell me this.

312
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,000
You must be Shiva,
the goddess of fertility.

313
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,280
<i>What are you insinuating?</i>

314
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,680
I didn’t come here
looking for a pension, you know?

315
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,400
Or for a divorce,

316
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,800
and much less for a paternity test.

317
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,160
I thought you loved me.

318
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,280
And...

319
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,320
And I think it’s a nice idea.

320
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,040
Hard to make it fit in our lives, but...

321
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,840
but a wonderful idea.

322
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,320
Listen!

323
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,640
What? Do you want to know
what I’m going to do with your child?

324
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,920
-That’s what you want, right?
-Listen to me, don’t rush...

325
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,200
Don’t move!

326
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,600
Freeze.

327
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,840
Don’t move! Don’t move or I’ll kill you!

328
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,600
-What’s the matter? Do something!
-Stand up!

329
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,960
Get out!

330
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,000
<i>Come on!</i>

331
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,360
Hurry up! Don’t move!

332
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,360
Come on!

333
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,400
Stay there!

334
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:34,960
Fuck!

335
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,480
Come on.

336
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,720
This way. Come on.

337
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,240
And this wonderful staircase,
made of marble and granite...

338
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,200
Don’t move!

339
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,240
Don’t move!

340
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,000
Don’t move! Come on!

341
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:07,920
Get back!

342
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,280
Please, don’t!

343
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,080
Professor, we have a problem.

344
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,280
I can’t see the little lamb.

345
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,840
I can’t fucking see her!

346
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,680
Miss Parker, where have you gone?

347
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,480
Wait.

348
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,720
-Please!
-Let’s go! That way!

349
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,640
Stop.

350
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,040
Okay.

351
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,240
Okay.

352
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,400
I’m going too fast. I know.

353
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,280
Let’s immortalize this, right?

354
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,800
Let’s take a picture with your phone.

355
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,720
Wait...

356
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,040
Fuck!

357
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,560
Here? It’s a bit seedy, isn't it?

358
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,320
It’s our first day.

359
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,120
You look so pretty.

360
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,680
I can’t find the girl.
I can’t fucking see her.

361
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,280
Open here. Open and look a bit sexy.

362
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,200
It’s your phone.
If you want, you can erase it.

363
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,400
This is for both of us, for you and me.

364
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,600
Come on.

365
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,680
With this photo
you're going to kill it on the Internet.

366
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,360
Give me my phone! I said give it to me!

367
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,560
Give me my phone! Give it to me!

368
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,480
Give me the fucking phone!
Give me the phone!

369
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,320
Give me the phone!

370
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,760
Give me the fucking phone!

371
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,000
First of all...

372
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,000
Good morning.

373
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,640
I’m the person in charge.

374
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,520
And, first of all, I want...

375
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,920
to offer my apologies.

376
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,080
Truly, this is not the way
to end the week.

377
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,040
Phone.

378
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,800
But you’re here as hostages.

379
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,400
Phone.

380
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,680
If you obey,
I guarantee you’ll be left alive.

381
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,800
-Name?
-Alison Parker.

382
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,640
-PIN?
-2078.

383
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,800
Phone.

384
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,360
Calm down, calm down.

385
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,240
Calm down.

386
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,240
PIN?

387
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,720
Why do you need the PIN?

388
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,960
Either you tell me the fucking PIN
or I’ll blow you with my rifle butt.

389
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,960
How long are you pregnant for?

390
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,120
Eight months.

391
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,240
Eight months.

392
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,680
PIN.

393
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,120
1234.

394
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,720
You look so smart,

395
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,840
but you’ve got that shitty PIN.
What an arsehole. Your name.

396
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,720
-Arturo.
-Arturo what?

397
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,280
-Arturo Román.
-Arturo Román, very well. Arturito.

398
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,560
You’re our safe-conduct here,
so I’m going to protect you.

399
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,160
Hey...

400
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,240
Give me your hands. Let go.

401
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,600
Let go.

402
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,720
What’s your name?

403
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,840
Ariadna.

404
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,200
Ariadna.

405
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,560
Come with me. Come.

406
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,760
Calm down.

407
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,600
Feel my hands.

408
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,240
Are these the hands of a monster?

409
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,360
No.

410
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,120
Because I’m not a monster.

411
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,800
I know perfectly how you feel.

412
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:26,040
The dry mouth, the shortness of breath....
You have to try to calm down. Breathe in.

413
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,320
Breathe in.

414
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,760
Breathe in.

415
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,080
That’s it.
Please, breathe with me, all of you.

416
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,560
Breathe in.

417
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,120
Easy, easy.

418
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,400
Make yourself responsible
for your breathing. Breathe out.

419
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,160
Very well.

420
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,960
Miss Monica Gaztambide, please?

421
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,360
Don’t move. Please, don’t move.

422
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,840
-Don’t even think about it.
-Be quiet.

423
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,360
-I said don't move.
-Be quiet.

424
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,760
Miss Monica Gaztambide,

425
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,720
would you be so kind as to step forward?

426
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,080
It’s me.

427
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,840
You’re a star, dad!

428
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,320
You’re the best!

429
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,000
You can sleep very well here, dad.

430
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,280
You can sleep grandly here.

431
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,240
Oh! Dad!

432
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,560
Fucking. Here, boom!

433
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,880
Boom, boom...

434
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,840
Come on, stop fooling around
and let’s get to work. Come on, jeez.

435
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,680
This smells fucking great.

436
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:01,560
It smells better than roast lamb,
dad, that roast lamb.

437
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,640
-Lay down here, damn it!
-Come on, fuck!

438
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,320
When have you had such a bed?
You didn’t have it in jail.

439
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,760
Have you seen where we are, dad?
We’re the best.

440
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,640
-We’re the best.
-Boy, don’t get this wrong.

441
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,920
We’re very small.

442
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,360
Can you do anything?

443
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,400
Have you ever had a job?

444
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:24,040
Have you ever left you CV anywhere?

445
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,280
Ah. Come on, jeez.

446
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,040
My CV.

447
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,240
My CV, what for?

448
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,720
To take you out of Alcalá-Meco?

449
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,080
Do you think I feel proud of that?

450
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,760
12 years of my life
coming in and out of prison.

451
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,720
And you know why?

452
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,720
Why?

453
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,360
Because I’m not very smart, son.

454
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,000
And neither are you.

455
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,760
But the brains of this job
is another person.

456
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,800
And if we’re lucky
and you don’t act like an arsehole,

457
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,920
you’ll leave this place
with your life settled.

458
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,280
-I’m not acting like an arsehole.
-Come on, jeez!

459
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,080
Fill them.

460
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,920
I want you to answer the phone

461
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,600
and convince whoever it is
that we are closed

462
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,240
due to a technical problem. Understood?

463
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:31,840
Yes.

464
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,200
I have no choice
but to point at you with a gun.

465
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,360
-Can you feel it?
-Yes.

466
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,200
Good.

467
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:45,840
Now.

468
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,640
Royal Mint of Spain, may I help you?

469
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,720
No, I’m sorry, I can’t put you
through Arturo right now.

470
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,000
The system is down.

471
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,160
No, I can’t bring him up here.

472
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,000
No, he can’t come here
to pick up the phone.

473
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,200
No, it can’t be.

474
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,800
No, because...

475
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:18,080
Just because,
I don’t know where he is right now,

476
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,840
I don’t know if he’s in the factory,
in the museum, in the canteen

477
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,400
or wherever he is!
And besides, that’s not my job, Miss!

478
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:34,960
That was a performance worthy of an Oscar,
Miss Gaztambide.

479
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,240
<i>20 minutes after coming in,
<i>we started to wire</i></i>

480
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,360
<i>the analogue communication system
<i>to talk to the Professor.</i></i>

481
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:01,080
<i>Without phones or radio frequency,
<i>with nobody being able to hear us.</i></i>

482
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:04,840
<i>We had sealed the doors
<i>and the alarms hadn’t set off.</i></i>

483
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,080
<i>We were like in a time limbo,</i>

484
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,720
<i>with nobody knowing we had taken over
<i>the Royal Mint of Spain.</i></i>

485
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,480
<i>And in that sweet peace, before the storm,</i>

486
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,520
<i>it just seemed</i>

487
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,200
<i>an ordinary day.</i>

488
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,640
You look handsome, right?

489
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,000
Who is it?

490
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,800
It’s me, let me in.

491
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:14,440
Rio, man. If the Professor sees us,
he’ll kill us, don’t you know?

492
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,240
I know, I know.
I have to talk to you. Sit down.

493
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,040
-What’s up?
-Sit down, damn it.

494
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,280
What’s up?

495
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,240
Tomorrow’s the heist.

496
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,240
And we have no fucking idea
what is going to happen.

497
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,960
That’s why I want you to know
I’m serious with you...

498
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,400
and...

499
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:37,840
I understand perfectly that, well,
that you’re not a child any more and...

500
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,560
and you may be looking for...

501
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,000
a more serious commitment.

502
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,600
That’s why I want to give you something.

503
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,360
I didn’t buy you a ring
because we’re locked up here,

504
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,200
but as soon as I go out
I’ll buy you such a big gem

505
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:59,080
you’ll need to carry your hand
in a fucking wheelbarrow.

506
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,560
What’s this?

507
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,680
An engagement badge?

508
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,720
Now at least you’ll know my real name.

509
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,880
Right, but we’re not allowed
to know each other’s names.

510
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,000
Well, don’t look at it.

511
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,000
But it’s yours.

512
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,320
How should I tell you this?

513
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:27,680
Our affair has been very well, okay?
Great.

514
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,880
We have slept together some nights...

515
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,200
What do you mean, some?
Jeez, all of them. But four or five...

516
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:40,680
Sincerely, I don’t think
we’re the perfect couple.

517
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,960
Don’t we fuck well?

518
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,520
Yes, we do fuck well, wonderfully.

519
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:45,960
That’s a start, right?

520
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,000
But you need something more
than fucking well to be a couple, right?

521
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,920
Are you saying that because
I’m 12 years younger than you?

522
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,120
I’m going to have
300 million euros, you know?

523
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,360
I’m not a child, my life is settled.

524
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:02,240
-Really, Rio, I wish we had...
-What do you mean with "had"?

525
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,000
There was love. There was, I was there.

526
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,000
There’s another man, right?

527
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,440
Not anymore.

528
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,280
Look, Rio,

529
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,920
when all this is over,
maybe you and I will go to Tahiti

530
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:31,440
and see if this works, but tomorrow
I only want to think about one thing:

531
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,960
not to get killed.

532
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,520
Rio.

533
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,680
Rio, don’t.

534
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,640
No.

535
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,680
You left a phone on.

536
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,920
Well, turn it off.

537
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,240
The vault is open.

538
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,760
Put on your vests and get ready to go out.

539
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,080
As soon as you’re ready,
we’ll activate the alarm.

540
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,640
Berlin, ready to open the doors.

541
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:01,720
Hostages, for your security,
all of you three steps back!

542
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,080
A little more over here. Very well.

543
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,520
Okay. Everything’s going to be all right.

544
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,240
A little closer.

545
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,040
Calm down.

546
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,880
Calm down. I can see the bags.
They’re full of money.

547
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,840
Now they’ll leave and it’ll be all right.

548
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,160
<i>There’s a 10-33
<i>at the Royal Mint of Spain.</i></i>

549
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,680
<i>Z24 on our way.
<i>We’ll get there in two minutes.</i></i>

550
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,640
Two minutes.

551
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,480
Two minutes.

552
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,360
Why did the alarm go off?

553
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,480
I don’t know.

554
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,720
They’re just standing there,
I don’t understand.

555
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,800
-Why don’t they take the money and leave?
-I don’t know!

556
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,200
One minute, 40 seconds.

557
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,440
One minute...

558
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,120
What’s your name?

559
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,680
Arturo.

560
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:37,040
-Arturo, right?
-Yes. No, I haven’t seen anything!

561
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,400
I haven’t seen anything, I swear,
I haven’t seen anything!

562
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,600
-Look at me.
-I haven’t seen anything.

563
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,840
Come on, Arturo, look at me.

564
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,560
Look at me.

565
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:48,200
Hey, hey, come on.

566
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:51,680
Hey.

567
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,520
Do you like cinema?

568
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,200
Do you like it?

569
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,960
I’m... I’m a big fan.

570
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,080
Have you realised in horror films

571
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:14,840
there’s always someone at the beginning,
like this, a nice guy like you,

572
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:18,160
and you think: "That guy’s going to die",

573
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,360
-and then it happens?
-No...

574
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:24,960
He always dies.

575
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:32,440
Arturo, believe me, you’re that guy.

576
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,720
<i>Z24 to headquarters,
<i>we’ll be there in 30 seconds.</i></i>

577
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:38,880
30 seconds.

578
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,400
30 seconds.

579
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,840
<i>It’s vital that the police</i>

580
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,560
don’t have the faintest idea
about what we’re doing.

581
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,600
We’ll make them believe
we came in for a heist,

582
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:55,880
they caught us by surprise leaving with
the money and everything was fucked up,

583
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:59,280
we took out the guns, shot point-blank
and we had no choice...

584
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:01,920
but to go back.

585
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,440
<i>And then,</i>

586
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:08,160
not having hurt anybody,

587
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,160
we get inside.

588
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,160
<i>Let them think we’re trapped like rats.</i>

589
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,240
<i>Let them think we’re improvising.</i>

590
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,160
Now!

591
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,800
Tokyo! Tokyo, wait, it’s too soon!

592
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:25,960
Tokyo!

593
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,840
<i>Go out, throw the money,
<i>shot at the ground and go back.</i></i>

594
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,240
<i>I’d heard that more than 30 times.</i>

595
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,520
<i>But what the Professor didn’t tell us</i>

596
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,920
<i>is that they would
<i>also shoot point-blank.</i></i>

597
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:45,520
Rio!

598
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,160
Holy shit, man!

599
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:42,440
Holy shit!

600
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:45,400
This couldn’t have started
fucking worse, man!

601
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,520
Fuck!

602
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:10,200
<i>Urgent support. We need urgent support.</i>

603
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:12,040
<i>In the Royal Mint of Spain.</i>

604
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:15,040
<i>We’ve got hostile gunfire. Officer down.
<i>I repeat, officer down.</i></i>

605
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:19,840
<i>An M16 bullet is fired at 3,510 kph.</i>

606
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:23,320
<i>It flies faster than the speed of sound.</i>

607
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,760
<i>So if you’re shot in the heart,</i>

608
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,880
<i>you won’t even hear
<i>the bullet that has killed you.</i></i>

609
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,360
<i>That’s how I knew I had fucked it all up,</i>

610
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,600
<i>in a millisecond</i>

611
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,360
<i>and the same way as usual.</i>
